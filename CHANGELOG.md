## 1.6.1
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Fixed video appearing upside down after export due to coordinate system mismatch between AVFoundation (top-left origin) and CIImage (bottom-left origin). The transform is now properly converted between coordinate systems.

## 1.6.0
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Fixed portrait mode videos being rotated incorrectly after export. The video rotation was being applied twice (once via layer instruction transform and again via orientation correction), causing portrait videos to appear with incorrect pixel orientation despite correct dimensions.
- **DEPRECATED**(metadata): `originalResolution` is now deprecated. Use `rawResolution` instead.
- **FIX**(android): Video metadata now returns display dimensions (after rotation correction), consistent with iOS/macOS. Previously, Android returned raw dimensions while iOS/macOS returned display dimensions.
- **FEAT**(metadata): Add `rawResolution` getter to retrieve the raw video dimensions before rotation is applied.

## 1.5.2
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Fixed color filters (`colorMatrixList`), blur, and flip effects being incorrectly applied to overlay images when `imageBytesWithCropping` is enabled. These effects are now applied only to the video before compositing the overlay.

## 1.5.1
- **FIX**(android): Fixed semi-transparent overlay layers appearing darker than expected during video rendering. The issue was caused by double alpha premultiplication — Android's BitmapFactory produces premultiplied pixels while Media3's overlay shader applies alpha again. Pixel data is now converted to straight alpha before uploading to the GPU.

## 1.5.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `imageBytesWithCropping` option to `VideoRenderData`. When enabled, the image overlay is applied before cropping and gets cropped together with the video instead of being scaled to the final cropped size.

## 1.4.2
- **FIX**(android): Fixed black edges appearing around transparent overlay layers during video rendering by using proper ARGB_8888 bitmap configuration and correct alpha blending.

## 1.4.1
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Fix Swift compiler type-check error by breaking up complex bit-shift expression into sub-expressions.

## 1.4.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `shouldOptimizeForNetworkUse` render option to enable progressive streaming by placing moov atom at file start (fast start). Enabled by default.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `isOptimizedForStreaming` metadata property to detect if a video has moov before mdat for streaming compatibility.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add optional `checkStreamingOptimization` parameter to `getMetadata()` for on-demand MP4 atom analysis.

## 1.3.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add waveform generation with `getWaveform` method to extract audio peak data for visualization.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add streaming waveform generation with `getWaveformStream` for progressive real-time waveform display.
- **FEAT**(widgets): Add `AudioWaveform` widget for static waveform visualization with playback position indicator and seek support.
- **FEAT**(widgets): Add `AudioWaveform.streaming` constructor for animated progressive waveform rendering during generation.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add WAV format support for audio extraction.

## 1.2.3
- **PERF**(android): Improves render performance on Android when mixing with a custom audio track.

## 1.2.2
- **FIX**(trim): Improved global trim precision by adding frame compensation to prevent encoder overshoot.

## 1.2.1
- **CHORE**: Adjusted code style to comply with lint rules.

## 1.2.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `hasAudioTrack` method to check if a video contains an audio track before attempting extraction.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `NO_AUDIO` error code and `AudioNoTrackException` for better error handling when videos have no audio track during extraction.

## 1.1.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add audio extraction feature with `extractAudio` and `extractAudioToFile` methods. Supports MP3, AAC, and M4A formats with optional trimming and bitrate configuration.

## 1.0.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add video concatenation with `videoClips` parameter for merging multiple videos.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add audio mixing with `customAudioPath`, `originalAudioVolume`, and `customAudioVolume` parameters for enhanced audio control.
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `jpegQuality` parameter to `ThumbnailConfigs` which allows setting the JPEG quality for thumbnails.
- **BREAKING** refactor(video_model): Rename `RenderVideoModel` to `VideoRenderData`.

## 0.4.0
- **FEAT**(android, iOS, macOS): Add `ProVideoEditor.instance.cancel(taskId)` for cancelling started export tasks.

## 0.3.0
- **FEAT**(presets): Add video quality presets for simplified export configuration. Details in PR [#55](https://github.com/hm21/pro_video_editor/pull/55).

## 0.2.4
- **CHORE**(android): Update Media3 dependencies to version 1.8.0.

## 0.2.3
- **FIX**(windows): Resolve issue of crashing when reading metadata on Windows.

## 0.2.2
- **FEAT**(metadata): Add `originalResolution` to metadata and auto-correct `resolution` based on video orientation.

## 0.2.1
- **FIX**(android): Resolved issue where metadata returned incorrect resolution for rotated videos. This resolves issue [#42](https://github.com/hm21/pro_video_editor/issues/42).

## 0.2.0
- **FEAT**: Add `renderVideoToFile` to return the file path instead of a Uint8List, preventing RAM overload on older devices or when handling larger videos.

## 0.1.8
- **FIX**(android): Fixed crash during video export when applying overlay effects. The issue was caused by using `ImmutableList.of(bitmapOverlay)` instead of a Kotlin-compatible list. This has been resolved by using `listOf(bitmapOverlay)` instead.
- **CHORE**(android): Updated `media3` dependencies to the latest stable versions for better compatibility and stability.

## 0.1.7
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Resolved a crash that occurred when setting playback speed below 1x. This resolves issue [#29](https://github.com/hm21/pro_video_editor/issues/29).

## 0.1.6
- **FIX**(iOS, macOS): Fixed rotation transforms not properly swapping render dimensions for 90°/270° rotations, resolving squeezed video output with black bars.

## 0.1.5
- **FIX**(window, linux, iOS, macOS): Correct bitrate extraction from metadata. 
- **FIX**(android): Remove unsupported WebM output format; Android only supports MP4 generation. 
- **TEST**: Add integration tests for all core functionalities.
